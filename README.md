# Patience
A basic java Card Game
A java project for my Degree Scheme.

The patience game being written is of the accordian variety.
The deck is shuffled, and 2 cards are played to the field.
The user then has the choice to play more cards, swapstack 2 cards with the same suit or number, or perform a jump if there is a 2 card gap between sourceCard and destinationCard. The aim of the game is the empty the deck and only have 1 pile remaining.

Currently I am reconstructing the GUI, as the GUI I had been using (provided by my lecturer) was not suitable to how I envisioned the game working.
